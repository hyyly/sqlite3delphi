SQLite for Delphi repository has been moved to GitHub:
http://github.com/plashenkov/SQLite3-Delphi-FPC


SQLite is a software library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. The source code for SQLite is in the public domain and is thus free for use for any purpose, commercial or private. SQLite is the most widely deployed SQL database engine in the world.

This package contains complete SQLite3 API translation for Delphi and FreePascal, as well as a simple Unicode-enabled object wrapper to simplify the use of this database engine.

Compatible with Delphi/C++Builder 6â€“XE2 and FreePascal/Lazarus.
